# FlashyCards v.4.0
A fun little Flash Cards program to help with basic math skills.

## How to Use

This app uses Python 3. After downloading, double-clicking the command file will open up and run the program in Terminal on MacOS.

## Starting Off

You'll start off by selecting an operand to work on. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, or a random set of problems. After selecting which set of problems you'd like to work on, you'll be prompted to choose how many problems you'd like to solve.

### Addition

Runs through problems adding two numbers together. The numbers range between 1 and 12.

### Subtraction

Runs through subtracting one number from another. Numbers range between 1 and 12, and answers can be negative numbers.

### Multiplcation 

Runs through problems multiplying two numbers together. Numbers range between 1 and 12.

### Division

Runs through problems dividing one number by another. The numerator can range between 2 and 100, and the divisor will range between 2 and 12. All answers will be whole integers with no remainders.

## Random Cards

The "Surprise Me" mode will randomly select one of the operand problems for each round. You will be prompted for how many rounds/cards you'd like to run through.

## Scoring

You get 1 point for each correct answer. At the end of the run, you'll be given your final score with a letter grade.
